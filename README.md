# cl-cookieproject

A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for Common Lisp projects featuring:

- Canonical Common Lisp project structure, a ready-to-use project with an entry point and unit tests.
- Run project from sources
- Build a binary
- and choose your Lisp implementation
- Test suite using [Fiveam](https://common-lisp.net/project/fiveam/docs/)
  - a [travis](https://travis-ci.org/) CI configuration file (untested)
- [Roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell/) recipe to build, install and share a binary
- example use of command line arguments
  (`uiop:command-line-arguments`). Proper parsing is left to do with a
  third-party library ([clingon](https://github.com/dnaeon/clingon), unix-opts, defmain, adoptâ€¦).

We are also shaping out a template for a web project, see [cl-cookieweb](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-cookieweb).

NEW! ðŸŽ¥ See our demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFc513MJjos

## Usage

Create a new project. You'll be prompted to provide some basic
information about your new project, which will then be auto-generated
in the current working directory:

```bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/vindarel/cl-cookieproject
project_name [cookie-lisp-project]:
repo_name [cookie-lisp-project]:
description []: A test project
version [0.0.1]:
year [1984]:
author [CL User]: me
email [me@mail.com]:
username [me]:
Initialised empty Git repository in /home/vince/bacasable/lisp-projects/cookie-lisp-project/.git/
```

Run it straight away:

```bash
$ cd cookie-lisp-project
$ sudo apt install rlwrap  # a utility to bring readline keybindings and history to SBCL on the terminal.
$ make run
rlwrap sbcl --load run.lisp
This is SBCL 2.0.10, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.
More information about SBCL is available at <http://www.sbcl.org/>.

[package cookie-lisp-project]
Hello from cookie-lisp-project!

```

You can see the `Hello` from the `main` function, and we are given a Lisp REPL.

Build an executable:

```bash
$ make build

$ ./cookie-lisp-project me
Hello me from cookie-lisp-project!

$ ./cookie-lisp-project -h
Usage:

  cookie-lisp-project [name]
```

Build it with Roswell:

```
$ ros build roswell/cookie-lisp-project.ros
```

A binary is created in the `roswell` directory.

Your users can install the application with:

```
$ ros install github_username/project_name
```


### Cookiecutter options

You can use command line options: https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/advanced/cli_options.html

- `--no-input`: do not prompt for parameters and only use cookiecutter.json file content
- ` --replay`: do not prompt for parameters and only use information entered previously
- ` -f, --overwrite-if-exists`: overwrite the contents of the output directory if it already exists
- ` -s, --skip-if-file-exists`: skip the files in the corresponding directories if they already exist
- ` -o, --output-dir`: where to output the generated project dir into
- ` --config-file`: user configuration file

The first time you run `cookiecutter` with a link to a GitHub repository, the skeleton is saved under `~/.cookiecutters/`. You can run the command for the second time with only the skeleton name:

    cookiecutter cl-cookieproject


## TODOs

- [ ] initialize a git repository
- [ ] better guess the author
- [ ] include a documentation system
- [X] [web project skeleton](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-cookieweb)
- [ ] more CI setup
- [ ] build a .deb (and .rpm)


## See also

- https://github.com/kjinho/cl-cookieproject/ (new)
  - a fork that uses Qlot for dependency management and ASDF package-inferred-system.

and:

- https://github.com/dnaeon/cl-skeleton
  - the newest of skeletons (late 2022), by an author with great contributed libraries.
  - an ASDF system, a test system, scripts for running the tests, Dockerfiles for ECL, CCL and SBCL implementations and Github Actions for building Docker images and running the test suite of the project.
  - just a shell script to fill-in the template files.
  - from what I see, the generated project is very simple, the .asd is barebones (no default op to build a binary with asdf:make for example). The value lies in the files around: the 3 little Dockerfiles (they use clfoundation's images, like I do for Gitlab CI), the script to run tests (they use `rove`, the script returns the correct error code).
- https://github.com/fukamachi/cl-project
  - one-package per file style (called "modern" but I find it too cumbersome to use)
  - uses the Rove test system (and I think it is not ready, see [this discussion](https://github.com/LispCookbook/cl-cookbook/issues/297) and its own issues)
  - less integration (no recipe to build binaries, use CLI args or use Roswell). Pure CL, doesn't need Cookiecutter (Python).
- https://github.com/triclops200/quickapp and [quickapp-cli](https://github.com/triclops200/quickapp-cli)
  - last commit 2016 / 2015
    - its `internal-quit` in app-utils.lisp should be `uiop:quit`
  - uses buildapp: kind of old and not needed now with `asdf:make` or Roswell? (proove me wrong)
  - includes an args parsing utility (it should probably use a more complete library though)
- https://www.xach.com/lisp/quickproject/
  - doesn't include a test definition
  - simple, nothing fancy.
- https://github.com/40ants/cl-project-with-docs
  - uses Sphinx and reStructured text to render nice and readable HTML documentation.
  - automatic gh-pages
  - includes tests, CI (Travis), Roswell
  - needs Sphinx (Python) and cl-launch.
  - 2018: I suspect the author has now another favourite documentation generator (MGLPAX, 40ants/doc) and might not update much this skeleton.
- https://github.com/40ants/project-templates : templates to create a CL library or a web app with Reblocks.
  - uses Quicklisp, Ultralisp, Qlot, CLPM, has Rove tests, has a GitHub CI, has docs (based on 40ants-doc). Based on the [mystic](https://github.com/roswell/mystic) templating system.
  - [Youtube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwcmOZ0DQf0)
  - created in 2023
  - as of writing, doesn't have a utility to quickly run the web app project from the terminal, but from the editor, so all in all maybe a bit hard to use for total beginners. Otherwise, it's a configuration totally worth checking out.
